In present day, a decade after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, visual artist Anthony McCoy and his girlfriend, gallery director Brianna Cartwright, move into a luxury loft condo in Cabrini, now gentrified beyond recognition and inhabited by upwardly mobile millennials.  With Anthony’s painting career on the brink of stalling, a chance encounter with a Cabrini Green old-timer exposes Anthony to the tragically horrific nature of the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifyingly viral wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny. </description></info><cast><name>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</name><name>Teyonah Parris</name><name>Nathan Stewart-Jarrett</name><name>Colman Domingo</name></cast><genre><name>Horror</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/universal/candyman/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/universal/candyman/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="199284413">https://trailers.apple.com/movies/universal/candyman/candyman-trailer-1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="24421"><info><title>Chick Fight</title><runtime>2:41</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Quiver Distribution</studio><postdate>2020-10-07</postdate><releasedate>2020-11-13</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2020 Quiver Distribution</copyright><director>Paul Leyden</director><description>Chick Fight follows Anna (Malin Akerman) as she navigates a particularly challenging juncture in her life: she still hasn’t reconciled with the recent death of her adored mother, she’s just discovered that her loving and supportive father is gay (which she totally supports, but the deception cuts deep), and she accidentally burns down her uninsured coffee shop when she discovers a casually thrown joint and a spilled bottle of moonshine don’t exactly mix. Knowing Anna needs to be abruptly shaken and stirred from her deep funk, her best friend Charleen (Dulcé Sloan) takes Anna to an all women underground fight club. It’s here that Anna encounters an eclectic cast of characters, including the intimidatingly perfect and most brutally efficient fighter of the club, Olivia (Bella Thorne), who quickly becomes a rival in and out of the ring. With the help of an eccentric and reclusive trainer Jack Murphy (Alec Baldwin), Anna slowly rediscovers herself, her inner strength and true purpose in the most primal of ways.</description></info><cast><name>Malin Akerman</name><name>Bella Thorne</name><name>Alec Baldwin</name><name>Dulcé Sloan</name><name>Kevin Connolly</name><name>Kevin Nash</name><name>Fortune Feimster</name><name>Dominique Jackson</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name><name>Romance</name><name>Action and Adventure</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/chick-fight/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/chick-fight/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="139760326">https://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/chick-fight/chick-fight-trailer-1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="18571"><info><title>Coco</title><runtime>2:27</runtime><rating>PG</rating><studio>Walt Disney Pictures</studio><postdate>2017-09-13</postdate><releasedate>2017-11-22</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2017 Walt Disney Pictures</copyright><director>Lee Unkrich, Adrian Molina</director><description>Despite his family’s baffling generations-old ban on music, Miguel (voice of newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) dreams of becoming an accomplished musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice of Benjamin Bratt).

So, the first prehistoric family sets off into the world in search of a safer place to call home. When they discover an idyllic walled-in paradise that meets all their needs, they think their problems are solved … except for one thing. Another family already lives there: the Bettermans.    The Bettermans (emphasis on the “better”)—with their elaborate tree house, amazing inventions and irrigated acres of fresh produce—are a couple of steps above the Croods on the evolutionary ladder. When they take the Croods in as the world’s first houseguests, it isn’t long before tensions escalate between the cave family and the modern family.    Just when all seems lost, a new threat will propel both families on an epic adventure outside the safety of the wall, one that will force them to embrace their differences, draw strength from each other and forge a future together. </description></info><cast><name>Nicolas Cage</name><name>Emma Stone</name><name>Ryan Reynolds</name><name>Catherine Keener</name><name>Cloris Leachman</name><name>Clark Duke</name><name>Leslie Mann</name><name>Peter Dinklage</name><name>Kelly Marie Tran</name></cast><genre><name>Family</name><name>Fantasy</name><name>Action and Adventure</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/the-croods-a-new-age/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/the-croods-a-new-age/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="177510400">https://trailers.apple.com/movies/dreamworks/the-croods-a-new-age/croods-2-trailer-2_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="23901"><info><title>The Dissident</title><runtime>2:59</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>Briarcliff Entertainment</studio><postdate>2020-09-10</postdate><releasedate/><copyright>© Copyright 1969 Briarcliff Entertainment</copyright><director>Bryan Fogel</director><description>From the Academy Award-winning director of Icarus, Bryan Fogel, comes the untold story of the murder that shook the world.</description></info><genre><name>Documentary</name><name>Thriller</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/the-dissident/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/the-dissident/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="161234728">https://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/the-dissident/the-dissident-trailer-1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="24661"><info><title>The Empty Man</title><runtime>1:36</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>20th Century Fox</studio><postdate>2020-10-20</postdate><releasedate>2020-10-23</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2020 20th Century Fox</copyright><director>David Prior</director><description>After a group of teens from a small Midwestern town begin to mysteriously disappear, the locals believe it is the work of an urban legend known as The Empty Man.

These two who share little in common are brought together through circumstance. Stanley, a high school dropout who has watched life pass by his drive-through window, proudly details the nuances of the job.

But when his recently widowed grandfather Ed (Robert De Niro) moves in with Peter’s family, the boy is forced to give up his most prized possession of all, his bedroom.

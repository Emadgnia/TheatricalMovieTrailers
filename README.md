## Use

The app presents a list of movie trailers using the iTunes Movie Trailers XML API.  
Tap on the Play button to start the trailer.

When an external screen is connected, the device displays only the poster artwork and play/pause button. The trailer video and related information for the last selected movie is shown on the connected screen.

## How to connect to a TV or external screen

On a real iOS device: use AirPlay Mirroring from Control Center or connect directly via a compatible adapter.

In the iOS Simulator: Click "I/O" in the menu bar, then choose any resolution under "External Displays".
